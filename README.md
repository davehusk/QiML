## 📜 Quantum-Inspired Language Model - Overview

This model uses a quantum-inspired approach to analyze and understand language, where words and phrases interact similarly to particles in a quantum system. Each word is represented by a **wave function**—a complex number encoding its **probability and context**. The relationships between words (entanglements) form a dynamically updated matrix that captures both **parallel and inverse meanings** based on their co-occurrence and alignment in sentences.

### Key Features 🌌
1. **Entanglement Matrix**: Captures relationships between words, giving insights into **semantic parallels** and context strength.
2. **Anti-Entanglement Matrix**: Tracks **inverse meanings** or words with contrasting associations, helping identify opposites.
3. **Eigenwords**: Words with high eigenvalues, or **principal components**, are central themes within the language context.
4. **Phrase Coherence**: Allows for **contextual similarity** analysis between phrases, simulating **quantum coherence** for linguistic alignment.

# 🧠 Quantum-Inspired Language Model 🧬

Welcome to the **Quantum-Inspired Language Model**, where words interact like quantum particles, and language takes on a whole new dimension! 🌠 This model allows for advanced language analysis using quantum principles, with **dynamic updates, contextual entanglements, and eigenword discovery**. Here’s how it works and how you can start exploring the quantum side of language!

## 🌟 Features & How It Works

1. **Quantum States for Words** 🌀
   - Each word has a **wave function** that represents its contextual and probabilistic meaning.
   - Wave functions are complex numbers, giving each word a unique “quantum” signature.

2. **Entanglement & Anti-Entanglement Matrices** 🧲
   - **Entanglement** captures contextual associations, where words that appear together are more entangled.
   - **Anti-Entanglement** reveals opposites by tracking words that don’t appear together, helping identify contrasting ideas.

3. **Principal Components (Eigenwords)** 🌌
   - By analyzing eigenvalues in the entanglement matrix, the model finds **core themes or concepts** in language.
   - These eigenwords act as the “anchors” or **principal components** of meaning.

4. **Phrase Coherence** 🔗
   - Allows comparison of phrases for **contextual alignment**—phrases that are quantum-coherent are semantically similar!
   - Great for text analysis, similarity checks, and finding meaning connections.

## 🛠 How to Use

```python
# Initialize model with text
model = QuantumLanguageModel("your initial text here")

# Update with more text
model.update_anti_entanglement_matrix("additional text to analyze")

# Query for entangled words with a specific term
entangled_words = model.collapse_matrix("quantum")

# Check for main themes (Eigenwords)
principal_words = model.principal_components()

# Analyze phrase coherence
phrase1 = "quantum entanglement creates new possibilities"
phrase2 = "complex states involve quantum coherence"
coherence_score = model.coherence_score(phrase1, phrase2)
```

---

## 🔍 Example Output

- **Collapsed State** (Querying "quantum") 🔍
  - Top entangled words: `using`, `complex`, `learning`, `fields`

- **Principal Components (Eigenwords)** 🌐
  - Main themes: `complex`, `using`, `quantum`

- **Phrase Coherence** 🔗
  - Coherence score for phrases: `3.67 + 0.55i`

## 🎉 Why It’s Awesome

This model gives a whole new approach to language analysis, incorporating quantum concepts like **superposition**, **entanglement**, and **eigenvalues**. It's perfect for researchers, linguists, or anyone curious about **contextual relationships in language**! 🚀
